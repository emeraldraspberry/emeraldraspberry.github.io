      <h4>Role</h4>
      <p>Followed the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) when implementing
         this website. Continuted to redefine and curate the website after 
         receiving feedback from the Discord community.
      </p>
      <h4>Difficulties</h4>
      <p>Despite being a small website, code reuse was a primary concern faced
         during development. The header, navigation, and footer were primary 
         areas of redundancy; having to update across all webpages. The website 
         was also originally not responsive for mobile devices.
      </p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>Following the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle, jQuery was used 
        to load common HTML components needed such as the header, navigation, 
        and footer content. The main page supports AJAX by fetching the latest 
        news from the Patch Notes page and displays them.

      <h4>Project</h4>
      <p>A project of interest demonstrating knowledge of Python and the PyQT5 
        cross-platform graphical user interface framework. Proof of concept PDF 
        file reader that required file handling and persistent storage. Goal was 
        to read PDF files that were compressed in an archive file format, without 
        having to extract them into secondary storage.
      </p>
      <h4>Difficulties</h4>
      <p>Most of the time spent on this project was in understanding the PyQT5
         framework and related troubleshooting. There was also the burden of 
         dealing with user interface design, and the task of implementing 
         multiple use cases.
      </p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>Using object oriented programming design, functionality was designated
         to their respective classes using the delegation pattern 
         (bookmark.py, pdf_handler.py). Multiple wireframes were drawn before 
         settling on a final design for the GUI. Use cases were further divided 
         down using the divide-and-conquer approach.

      <h4>Project</h4>
      <p>Requested by an associate for a Discord server, implementing online
         user status tracking functionality using Python and SQLite.
      </p>
      <h4>Difficulties</h4>
      <p>Since the functionality of the bot has to track each user of the server
         24/7, 99.9% uptime was the primary obstacle faced. Hosting this one a 
         primary computer would be infeasible. Storage also had to be decided, 
         one that is corruption-resistant.
      </p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>A single-board computer was used to host the bot program, with very
         minimal power consumption. Shell scripts were used to ensure that the 
         board loads the bot each time it restarts, offering the best uptime
         possible. SQLite was chosen for its ACID (Atomcity, Consistency,
         Isolation, Durability) compliance.
